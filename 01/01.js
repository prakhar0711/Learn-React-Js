//react is not a framework it is a library(react and react-dom are for web pages)
//react and react-native are used for app development
//npm-node package manager
//npx-node package executor

//1st method for a react project
//npx-create-react-app to initiazlise a react project(this is a really slow process there are alternatives for it one such is Vite or Parcel)
//A directory '01_basicreact' using create-react-app is initialised
//Inside it the package.json file is the entry point that contains versions and dependencies
//npm run start to start project in localhost
//npm run build to build the project

// method using vite
//vite is a bundler
//npm create vite@latest
//before running a vite project we must first install the node-module folder using npm i or npm install
//to run - npm run dev


// 01_basicreact and 01_vite-react are just two folders initialised by two different methodsto see the working and the control flow of react library and their differences
