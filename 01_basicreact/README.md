---- created using the basic react initialisation<br>
---- 1st method for a react project<br>
1) npx-create-react-app to initiazlise a react project(this is a really slow process there are alternatives for it one such is Vite or Parcel)<br>
2) A directory '01_basicreact' using create-react-app is initialised<br>
3) Inside it the package.json file is the entry point that contains versions and dependencies<br>
4) npm run start to start project in localhost<br>
5) npm run build to build the project<br>

----for both project initialisations it is a convention to capitalise the first letter of any file or any function<br>
