created using the basic react initialisation
<br>1st method for a react project
<br>npx-create-react-app to initiazlise a react project(this is a really slow process there are alternatives for it one such is Vite or Parcel)
//A directory '01_basicreact' using create-react-app is initialised
//Inside it the package.json file is the entry point that contains versions and dependencies
//npm run start to start project in localhost
//npm run build to build the project

//for both project initialisations it is a convention to capitalise the first letter of any file or any function
