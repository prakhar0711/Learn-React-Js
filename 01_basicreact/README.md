# Basic React Initialization

This project was created using the basic initialization method for a React project.

## Initial Steps

1. Initiate a React project using `npx-create-react-app`. Note that this process can be slow, but there are alternative tools available such as Vite or Parcel.
2. Create a directory named `01_basicreact` using `create-react-app`.
3. Inside the `01_basicreact` directory, you'll find the `package.json` file, which serves as the entry point and contains information about versions and dependencies.
4. Start the project locally using `npm run start`.
5. Build the project using `npm run build`.

## File and Function Naming Convention

For both project initializations, it is a convention to capitalize the first letter of any file or function.
