## Setting Up Vite for Project Initialization

Vite is a modern bundler for web development that provides a fast and efficient development experience. Follow these steps to initialize a project using Vite:

1. Install Vite globally using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g create-vite
   ```

2. Create a new Vite project by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
   ```

3. Before running a Vite project, ensure to install the node_modules folder by executing:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. To start the development server, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Naming Convention

When initializing projects or creating files and functions, it is a common convention to capitalize the first letter. This helps maintain consistency and readability across the codebase.

Following this convention ensures that files and functions are easily identifiable and distinguishable from variables and other elements in the code.

By adhering to naming conventions, developers can improve code maintainability and collaboration within the project.

Remember to follow this convention when creating new files or functions in your Vite projects.
