//components

In App.jsx there is a function as function App(){} which is given to the main.jsx file to render it

created a new file in src folder (in this folder created a file HelloWorld.jsx)

create a function (created function Hello())

return()

add html tags inside it (added basic html to print on the webpage)

export the function

now send the function to app.jsx by importing it and returning it
(rendered the component in App.jsx)

when vite is used to create a project it is default or must best practice to end file with a .jsx extension and function names should start with a capital letter

this export is called component but it is not doing any complex activity

for both project initialisations it is a convention to capitalise the first letter of any file or any function
