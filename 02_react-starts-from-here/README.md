---- Components<br>

1. In App.jsx there is a function as function App(){} which is given to the main.jsx file to render it<br>

2. created a new file in src folder (in this folder created a file HelloWorld.jsx)<br>

3. create a function (created function Hello())<br>

4. return()<br>

5. add html tags inside it (added basic html to print on the webpage)<br>

6. export the function<br>

7. now send the function to app.jsx by importing it and returning it
   (rendered the component in App.jsx)<br>

---- when vite is used to create a project it is default or must best practice to end file with a .jsx extension and function names should start with a capital letter

---- this export is called component but it is not doing any complex activity

---- for both project initialisations it is a convention to capitalise the first letter of any file or any function
