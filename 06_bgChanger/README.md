# Creating a Color Changing Button App with React

In this tutorial, we'll build a simple React application that manages color state and displays color-changing buttons.

## Overview

The application will consist of a viewport div that changes its background color based on the selected color from the buttons displayed at the bottom of the screen. Each button corresponds to a different color option.

### 1. Setting Up the Project

- Initialize a new React project.
- Create a new component file named `App.jsx`.
- Import the `useState` hook from React.
- Set up a basic structure for the `App` component.

### 2. Managing Color State

- Utilize the `useState` hook to manage the color state.
- Initialize the `color` state variable with a default color value.

### 3. Creating Color-changing Buttons

- Design a set of buttons to change the background color.
- Implement click event handlers for each button to update the color state accordingly.

### 4. Styling the Application

- Use CSS to style the buttons and the viewport div.
- Apply dynamic styling to the buttons to reflect their respective colors.

### 5. Testing and Debugging

- Run the React development server to test the application.
- Verify that clicking on each button changes the background color as expected.
- Debug any issues related to state management or event handling.

### 6. Deployment

- Once the application is complete and tested, deploy it to a hosting service.
- Consider using platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages for deployment.

### 7. Documentation and Sharing

- Document the project, including installation instructions and usage guidelines.
- Share the project with others on GitHub or other code-sharing platforms.

By following these steps, you'll create a simple yet interactive React application that demonstrates state management and user interaction through color-changing buttons.
