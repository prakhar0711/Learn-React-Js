### Steps to Code the Tic-Tac-Toe Game:

1. **Set Up Your React Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
   - Create a new React app using Create React App:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app tic-tac-toe
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd tic-tac-toe
     ```

2. **Open `src/App.js` File:**
   - Open the `src/App.js` file in your code editor.

3. **Import React, useState, and useCallback:**
   - Import the necessary modules at the top of the file:
     ```javascript
     import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";
     import "./App.css";
     ```

4. **Define Functional Component:**
   - Create a functional component named `App`:
     ```javascript
     function App() {
       // Logic will go here
     }
     ```

5. **Initialize State Variables:**
   - Use the `useState` hook to define state variables for the game board and whose turn it is:
     ```javascript
     const [state, setState] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));
     const [isXTurn, setIsXTurn] = useState(true);
     ```

6. **Implement Winning Logic:**
   - Define a function (`checkWin`) to check for winning combinations after each move:
     ```javascript
     const checkWin = useCallback((copyState) => {
       // Check all winning combinations
       // Update the state accordingly
     }, []);
     ```

7. **Handle Clicks on Game Board:**
   - Implement a function (`handleClick`) to handle clicks on the game board:
     ```javascript
     const handleClick = useCallback((index) => {
       // Update the game board based on the clicked box
       // Check for a winner
       // Update the turn
     }, []);
     ```

8. **Reset the Game Board:**
   - Create a function (`resetBoard`) to reset the game board when the "Reset" button is clicked:
     ```javascript
     const resetBoard = () => {
       // Reset the game board to initial state
     };
     ```

9. **Render UI Elements:**
   - Return JSX elements to render the game board, including boxes, and the "Reset" button:
     ```javascript
     return (
       <>
         {/* Render game board */}
         {/* Handle clicks on boxes */}
         {/* Display "Reset" button */}
       </>
     );
     ```

10. **Export the Component:**
    ```javascript
    export default App;
    ```

11. **Style Your App (Optional):**
    - Create a CSS file (`App.css`) and add styles to enhance the appearance of your game board.

12. **Run Your App:**
    - Start the development server:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```
    - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view and play your Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Now you have a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React! You can further customize and enhance it based on your preferences and requirements.
