### Steps to Code the Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Vite:

1. **Create a New Vite Project:**
   - Initialize a new Vite project using npm:
     ```bash
     npm create vite@latest tic-tac-toe --template react
     ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   - Move into the newly created project directory:
     ```bash
     cd tic-tac-toe
     ```

3. **Install Necessary Dependencies:**
   - Install React and ReactDOM if they're not already included:
     ```bash
     npm install react react-dom
     ```

4. **Open `src/App.jsx` File:**
   - Open the `src/App.jsx` file in your code editor.

5. **Import React, useState, and useCallback:**
   - Import the necessary modules at the top of the file:
     ```jsx
     import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";
     import "./App.css"; // If you're using a CSS file for styling
     ```

6. **Define Functional Component:**
   - Create a functional component named `App`:
     ```jsx
     function App() {
       // Logic will go here
     }
     ```

7. **Initialize State Variables:**
   - Use the `useState` hook to define state variables for the game board and whose turn it is:
     ```jsx
     const [state, setState] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));
     const [isXTurn, setIsXTurn] = useState(true);
     ```

8. **Implement Winning Logic:**
   - Define a function (`checkWin`) to check for winning combinations after each move:
     ```jsx
     const checkWin = useCallback((copyState) => {
       // Check all winning combinations
       // Update the state accordingly
     }, []);
     ```

9. **Handle Clicks on Game Board:**
   - Implement a function (`handleClick`) to handle clicks on the game board:
     ```jsx
     const handleClick = useCallback((index) => {
       // Update the game board based on the clicked box
       // Check for a winner
       // Update the turn
     }, []);
     ```

10. **Reset the Game Board:**
    - Create a function (`resetBoard`) to reset the game board when the "Reset" button is clicked:
      ```jsx
      const resetBoard = () => {
        // Reset the game board to initial state
      };
      ```

11. **Render UI Elements:**
    - Return JSX elements to render the game board, including boxes, and the "Reset" button:
      ```jsx
      return (
        <>
          {/* Render game board */}
          {/* Handle clicks on boxes */}
          {/* Display "Reset" button */}
        </>
      );
      ```

12. **Export the Component:**
    ```jsx
    export default App;
    ```

13. **Style Your App (Optional):**
    - Create a CSS file (`App.css`) and add styles to enhance the appearance of your game board.

14. **Run Your App:**
    - Start the Vite development server:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
    - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view and play your Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Now you have a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React and Vite! You can further customize and enhance it based on your preferences and requirements.
