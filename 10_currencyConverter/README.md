# we will create our own custom react hook by creating a currency converter project
## complexity will be high for this project

1. Create a hook folder in src inside it create a js file that will be used for your api calls which will contain a function that takes in currency and a useEffect hook
2. fetch the api and convert the data to json format and hold it into a useState hook that is declared inside the function
