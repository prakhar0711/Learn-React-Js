### Steps to Code the React App with Navigation using React Router:

1. **Set Up Your React Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
   - Create a new React app using Create React App:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app my-router-app
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd my-router-app
     ```

2. **Install React Router:**
   - Install React Router to handle navigation within the application:
     ```bash
     npm install react-router-dom
     ```

3. **Create Component Files:**
   - Create separate component files for `Home`, `About`, and `Users` inside the `src/components` directory.
   - Define the content for each component file. For example:
     - `Home.js`:
       ```jsx
       import React from 'react';

       function Home() {
         return <h2>Home Page</h2>;
       }

       export default Home;
       ```
     - Similarly, create `About.js` and `Users.js` with appropriate content.

4. **Open `src/App.js` File:**
   - Replace the content of `src/App.js` with the provided code snippet.

5. **Import Necessary Modules:**
   - Import required modules from React Router and the component files:
     ```javascript
     import Home from "./components/Home";
     import About from "./components/About";
     import Users from "./components/Users";
     import { BrowserRouter as Router, Link, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
     ```

6. **Define Routes and Navigation:**
   - Use React Router components to set up routes and navigation:
     - Wrap the content with `Router` component to enable routing.
     - Use `Link` components to create navigation links.
     - Define routes using `Routes` and `Route` components, specifying the path and the corresponding component to render.

7. **Run Your App:**
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view your React app with navigation.

### App Logic Overview:

- **Navigation:** The app provides a navigation menu with links to Home, About, and Users pages.
- **Routes:** React Router manages the routing by mapping specific URLs to corresponding components.
- **Components:** Each component (`Home`, `About`, `Users`) represents a different page of the application and contains the respective content to be rendered.

This setup allows for seamless navigation between different pages of the React application using React Router. You can further enhance the app by adding more pages, implementing nested routes, or incorporating additional features as needed.
